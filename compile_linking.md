# Compiler and Linker

## Compilation
    the compiler takes source code and produces object files as the output,
    these files usually have the .o extension

## Linking
    A linker takes one or more object files,
    possibly adds external library, and 
    links it all into an excutable

    each object file is likely to refer to functions that are contained in other files,
    resolving those dependencies is part of the lnker's job
